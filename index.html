<li><ol><li>When is the best time to visit the Disneyland Resort?</li><li>"It's always a great time to visit Disney theme parks! However  when planning a trip to the Disneyland Resort  expect lower crowds from mid-September through mid-November (before the Thanksgiving break). Mid-January through mid-March is another time when potentially lower crowds are expected. The parks are generally less busy during these 2 periods  which make it an ideal time to explore. Generally there is no ""off-peak"" time to visit  but throughout the year some of our Annual Passholders experience blockout days that make crowd levels more manageable for many Guests. Planning a Disneyland Resort vacation during less busy  less crowded times also results in a greater choice of available rooms at the Disneyland Hotel and Disneys Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. The benefit of visiting the Disneyland Resort during less crowded months is that wait times may be shorter  allowing you to do more. However  Disney California Adventure Park and Disneyland Park typically reduce their operating hours at such times. Additionally  attractions are more frequently closed for refurbishment and fewer entertainment options and events may be scheduled during these periods. If you want to attend while the theme parks have extended hours  entertainment  events and most attractions operating  plan your visit on a weekend  including extended holiday weekends during: Christmas and Spring Break June through August However  crowding is usually higher during these times. For a complete list of hours  entertainment  events and refurbishments  go to the Park Hours section and enter the dates of your visit  or contact Disneyland Resort Guest Information at (714) 781-4565. Guests under 18 must have parent or guardian permission to call. Ready to book your Disneyland Resort visit? Buy tickets  vacations packages and more!

<li><ol><li>What is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and how is it used at the Disneyland Resort?</li><li>Bluetooth technology is a communication standard designed for short-range data exchange between devices. You may be familiar with it as it is commonly a feature in mobile phones  smart watches and even cars. BLE is a form of Bluetooth communication that requires only low power consumption  which is ideal for some kinds of device-to-device communication that only require small amounts of information to be sent or received. Select locations throughout Disneyland Resort (the Resort) include BLE beacons  which are small radio transmitters. These BLE beacons may communicate with certain other Bluetooth-enabled devices  such as mobile phones or smart devices that have Bluetooth capability. The exchange of information is designed to allow you to enable certain interactive or personalized experiences and to improve the Guest experience. Guests can visit the Resort without using BLE; however  certain features of the Resort experience are dependent upon BLE  including some personalized offerings. To participate using your Bluetooth-enabled mobile device  (1) download the Disneyland app or the Play Disney Parks app (collectively Disneyland Parks apps) to your mobile device; (2) grant the app you are using permission to access your location; and (3) enable Bluetooth services using your device settings. Certain personalized experiences may also require that Guests be signed in to their Disney account on the app. For other BLE-enabled products  including  for example  Astromech Droid Units or Made with Magic Connected Ear Hats  the device will automatically enable the Bluetooth technology when the device is turned on. Guests can enjoy our theme parks without using BLE-enabled devices or products. Guests who have one or more Disneyland Parks apps on their mobile devices but do not want to receive interactive or personalized experiences based on interaction with such apps may disable the Bluetooth functionality on their device or disable the location permission for the installed Disneyland Parks apps while visiting the parks. Guests who have the Astromech Droid Units but do not want to receive interactive or personalized experiences based on interactions with the Droid may power off their Droid while visiting the parks. Note that an Astromech Droid Unit may interact with other Astromech Droid Units outside of the Resort if both units are turned on. The BLE beacons are not GPS-based and do not enable collection of continuous location signals.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol><li>What information does the Disneyland Resort collect through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and how is this information used?</li><li>BLE beacons at locations within the Disneyland Resort (the Resort) communicate with the Disneyland app or the Play Disney Parks app (collectively  Disneyland Parks apps) on your Bluetooth-enabled mobile device and certain other BLE-enabled devices or products  such as the Astromech Droid Units (collectively your BLE-enabled devices) to trigger certain effects or experiences on your BLE-enabled devices. In addition  your BLE-enabled devices may also broadcast data that  when received by our BLE beacons  may allow us to provide other interactive or personalized experiences. For example  when you use the Play Disney Parks app at Star Wars: Galaxys Edge  certain functions performed with the app may trigger physical effects in the land. Our BLE beacons may also receive data broadcast by your BLE-enabled devices to determine your relative position and enable certain personalized experiences.</li></ol></li>

COVID-19 And Any Other Communicable Or Infectious Disease: Liability Waiver  Class-Action Waiver  Binding Arbitration  And Other Provisions By purchasing an admission ticket(s) and/or by making a park  resort  and/or hotel reservation(s)  and in consideration thereof  and in consideration for being able to visit and/or participate in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort  I agree  understand  and acknowledge  on my own behalf and on behalf of any individual who uses a ticket or reservation made by me  as follows (collectively  the COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision): Assumption Of Risk : I acknowledge that an inherent risk of exposure to the disease COVID-19 (as defined by the World Health Organization and any strains  variants  or mutations thereof) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that can cause COVID-19) (collectively  COVID-19)  and any other communicable or infectious disease  exists in any public place where people are present.

Infectious disease means any disease or illness caused by microorganisms such as bacteria  viruses  parasites  or fungi that enter the body  multiply  and can cause an infection. COVID-19 is an extremely contagious communicable disease that can lead to severe illness and death. No precautions can eliminate the risk of exposure to COVID-19  and the risk of exposure applies to everyone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  older adults (people 65 years and older) and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19. I acknowledge that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and any other communicable or infectious disease includes the risk that I will expose others that I later encounter  even if I am not experiencing or displaying any symptoms of illness myself. By visiting and/or participating in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort  I agree to voluntarily assume any and all risks in any way related to exposure to COVID-19 and any other communicable or infectious disease  including illness  injury  or death of myself or others  and including without limitation  all risks based on the sole  joint  active or passive negligence of any of the Released Parties  named below.

This waiver of liability and the assumption of risk set forth above is intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by law. Acknowledgment Of Assumption Of Risk And Waiver By Other Users : I attest  acknowledge  and agree that any individual for whom I have bought a ticket or made a reservation or who uses a ticket or reservation made by me has independently and carefully read this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision and has knowingly and independently acknowledged and agreed to all its provisions  including without limitation (1) to voluntarily assume any and all risks in any way related to exposure to COVID-19 and any other communicable or infectious disease  including illness  injury  or death of himself  herself  or others  and including without limitation  all risks based on the sole  joint  active or passive negligence of any of the Released Parties  named below  and (2) to agree  on his or her own behalf and on behalf of his or her heirs  executors  personal representatives  administrators  and assigns  to forever waive  covenant not to sue  release  and discharge the Released Parties  named below  from any and all liability  claims  causes of action  damages  costs  or expenses of every kind  including all claims and causes of action based on the sole  joint  active  or passive negligence of any of the Released Parties  arising out of or in any way relating to exposure to COVID-19 and any other communicable or infectious disease during his or her visit to and/or participation in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort. Waiver On Behalf Of Minor Children : For any minor child for whom I have bought a ticket or made a reservation or who uses a ticket or reservation purchased and/or made by me  I agree and acknowledge that I am the minor childs natural and/or otherwise legal guardian and I am authorized to and do waive and release  in advance  any of the following that would accrue to the minor child: any and all liability  claims  causes of action  damages  costs  or expenses of every kind  including all claims and causes of action based on the sole  joint  active or passive negligence of any of the Released Parties  arising out of or in any way relating to exposure to COVID-19 and any other communicable or infectious disease during the minor childs visit to and/or participation in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort. Third-Party Beneficiaries : I acknowledge and agree that any individual for whom I have bought a ticket or made a reservation or who uses a ticket or reservation made by me is and is intended to be a third-party beneficiary of that ticket or reservation made by me. Waiver of California Civil Code  1542 : I acknowledge and agree that I am familiar with  understand  and do waive any rights and benefits of the provisions of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code  and any similar provisions of other jurisdictions  which provides that: A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that  if known by him or her  would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party. Indemnity/Insurance : On my own behalf and on behalf of my heirs  executors  personal representatives  administrators  and assigns  I agree to indemnify and hold each of the Released Parties harmless from and against any and all claims made or incurred by anyone  including myself and any individual who uses a ticket or reservation made by me  arising out of or in any way relating to my purchase of an admission ticket(s) and/or my making of a reservation(s)  and subsequent visit to and/or participation in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort and arising out of any and all risks described above in the section titled Assumption of Risk or in any other way related to exposure to COVID-19 and any other communicable or infectious disease  wherever such activities may occur and whether suffered before  during  or after such participation. My indemnification obligations shall include  without limitation  all attorneys fees and costs incurred by any of the Released Parties through and including any appeals. I understand and agree that I am not relying on the Released Parties to have arranged for  or carry  any insurance of any kind for my benefit relative to my visit to and/or participation in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort  and that I am solely responsible for obtaining any mandatory or desired life  travel  accident  property  or other insurance related to my visit to and/or participation in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort  at my own expense. Scope : I agree that the Waiver and Indemnity provided for in this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision shall cover all physical and emotional injuries and/or damages  including without limitation all illness and bodily injury (including death)  whether suffered by me or anyone else before  during  or after my visit and/or participation. Additionally  I agree that the scope of the Waiver and Indemnity shall include any claims related  in whole or in part  to my own actions and the actions of third parties  whether foreseeable or unforeseeable. Term : The Waiver and Indemnity provided for in this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/ Infectious Disease Provision applies to any and all visitation to and/or participation in attractions  transportation  and activities at the Disneyland Resort and/or presence on the Released Parties property arising out of the purchase of an admission ticket(s) and/or the making of a reservation(s) pursuant to which I and the Released Parties agreed to this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision  from the date of execution. Released Parties : The Released Parties are: Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S.  Inc.; Disney Destinations  LLC; Disney Vacation Development  Inc.; Disney Vacation Club Management LLC; and their respective parents  subsidiary  and other affiliated or related companies  and all officers  directors  employees  shareholders  members  agents  contractors  sub-contractors  representatives  successors  assigns  insurers  and volunteers of each of the foregoing entities. Severability/Partial Invalidity : If any provision or part thereof of this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision is held to be invalid  void  or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction  such provision or part thereof shall be deemed modified to conform to applicable law  or if this would cause an illogical or unreasonable result  such provision or part thereof shall be stricken from this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision without affecting the binding force or effect of any other part or provision. Binding Arbitration: I AGREE THAT  UPON ELECTION BY EITHER PARTY  ANY DISPUTE  CLAIM  OR CONTROVERSY ARISING UNDER OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS COVID-19 AND OTHER COMMUNICABLE/INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROVISION OR EXPOSURE TO COVID-19 AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICABLE OR INFECTIOUS DISEASE DURING MY VISIT TO AND/OR PARTICIPATION IN ATTRACTIONS  TRANSPORTATION  AND ACTIVITIES AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT  NOW OR IN THE FUTURE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. CLAIMS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION INCLUDE COUNTERCLAIMS  CROSS CLAIMS  THIRD PARTY CLAIMS  INTERPLEADERS  OR ANY OTHER CLAIMS  WHATEVER THE CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ASSERTED (INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE  DECLARATORY  OR EQUITABLE RELIEF). I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ARBITRATION REPLACES MY RIGHT TO GO TO COURT. I THEREFORE AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO LITIGATE ANY CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. I AGREE THAT I THEREFORE WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO LITIGATE ANY CLAIMS IN COURT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE ACTION (SUCH AS AN ACTION IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL). I ALSO AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE IN ARBITRATION ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE ACTION (SUCH AS AN ACTION IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL)  OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. I ALSO AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING CAN BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation  applicability  or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision  including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision is void or voidable. In the event of a dispute  I agree to send a notice of dispute  which is a written statement that sets forth my name  address  and contact information; the facts giving rise to the dispute; and the relief requested to the Released Parties at 500 South Buena Vista Street  Burbank  California 91521-7620  USA  Attention: Legal. The Released Parties will send any notice of dispute to me at the contact information that they have for me. The Released Parties and I will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before  the Released Parties or I may commence an arbitration proceeding. I may instead litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court  whether or not I negotiated informally first. If the Released Parties and I do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court  the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act  9 U.S.C.  1 et seq. Arbitration will be administered by JAMS Mediation  Arbitration and ADR Services (JAMS) in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the JAMS Rules). The JAMS Rules and instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. Arbitration may be conducted in person  through the submission of documents  by phone  or online. Proceedings that cannot be conducted through the submission of documents  by phone  or online  will take place in Orange County  California; provided  however  that if circumstances prevent me from traveling to Orange County  California  JAMS may hold an in-person hearing in my hometown area. The Released Parties and I agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Orange County  California in order to compel arbitration  to stay proceedings pending arbitration  or to confirm  modify  vacate  or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may award damages to me individually as a court could  including declaratory or injunctive relief  but only to the extent required to satisfy my individual claim. In accordance with the JAMS Rules  the party initiating the arbitration (either me or the Released Parties) is responsible for paying the filing fee. However  if the arbitrator issues me an award of damages and: (a) that award is greater than the amount of the Released Parties last written settlement offer; or (b) if the Released Parties did not make a settlement offer  then in addition to paying for any JAMS Case Management Fees and all professional fees for the arbitrators services  the Released Parties will reimburse me for the filing fees I incurred. Except as provided above with respect to jurisdiction in Orange County  California  nothing in this arbitration provision shall be construed as consent by the Released Parties to the jurisdiction of any other court with regard to disputes  claims  or controversies unrelated to this agreement. This agreement to binding arbitration evidences a transaction in interstate commerce  and thus the Federal Arbitration Act  9 U.S.C.  1-16  governs its interpretation and enforcement. This agreement to binding arbitration will survive its termination. If any portion of this agreement to binding arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable  the remaining portions shall nevertheless remain in force. Venue But For Arbitration: In the event that neither party elects to resolve disputes under binding arbitration  as provided above  any legal action arising out of or relating to this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision shall be commenced exclusively in the Superior Court of California  County of Orange (or if such Superior Court shall not have jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof  then to such other court sitting in said county and having subject matter jurisdiction). In any such action  I specifically waive any right to bring a class action or other representative or collective action (such as an action in the form of a private attorney general). Governing Law: These terms and conditions  including this COVID-19 and Other Communicable/Infectious Disease Provision shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.</li></ol></li>

<li><ol><li>What is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and how is it used at the Disneyland Resort?</li><li>Bluetooth technology is a communication standard designed for short-range data exchange between devices. You may be familiar with it as it is commonly a feature in mobile phones  smart watches and even cars. BLE is a form of Bluetooth communication that requires only low power consumption  which is ideal for some kinds of device-to-device communication that only require small amounts of information to be sent or received. Select locations throughout Disneyland Resort (the Resort) include BLE beacons  which are small radio transmitters. These BLE beacons may communicate with certain other Bluetooth-enabled devices  such as mobile phones or smart devices that have Bluetooth capability. The exchange of information is designed to allow you to enable certain interactive or personalized experiences and to improve the Guest experience. Guests can visit the Resort without using BLE; however  certain features of the Resort experience are dependent upon BLE  including some personalized offerings. To participate using your Bluetooth-enabled mobile device  (1) download the Disneyland app or the Play Disney Parks app (collectively Disneyland Parks apps) to your mobile device; (2) grant the app you are using permission to access your location; and (3) enable Bluetooth services using your device settings. Certain personalized experiences may also require that Guests be signed in to their Disney account on the app. For other BLE-enabled products  including  for example  Astromech Droid Units or Made with Magic Connected Ear Hats  the device will automatically enable the Bluetooth technology when the device is turned on. Guests can enjoy our theme parks without using BLE-enabled devices or products. Guests who have one or more Disneyland Parks apps on their mobile devices but do not want to receive interactive or personalized experiences based on interaction with such apps may disable the Bluetooth functionality on their device or disable the location permission for the installed Disneyland Parks apps while visiting the parks. Guests who have the Astromech Droid Units but do not want to receive interactive or personalized experiences based on interactions with the Droid may power off their Droid while visiting the parks. Note that an Astromech Droid Unit may interact with other Astromech Droid Units outside of the Resort if both units are turned on. The BLE beacons are not GPS-based and do not enable collection of continuous location signals.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol><li>What information does the Disneyland Resort collect through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and how is this information used?</li><li>BLE beacons at locations within the Disneyland Resort (the Resort) communicate with the Disneyland app or the Play Disney Parks app (collectively  Disneyland Parks apps) on your Bluetooth-enabled mobile device and certain other BLE-enabled devices or products  such as the Astromech Droid Units (collectively your BLE-enabled devices) to trigger certain effects or experiences on your BLE-enabled devices. In addition  your BLE-enabled devices may also broadcast data that  when received by our BLE beacons  may allow us to provide other interactive or personalized experiences. For example  when you use the Play Disney Parks app at Star Wars: Galaxys Edge  certain functions performed with the app may trigger physical effects in the land. Our BLE beacons may also receive data broadcast by your BLE-enabled devices to determine your relative position and enable certain personalized experiences.</li></ol></li>
